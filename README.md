# Whack-A-Mole!

Whack-A-Mole game written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Jquery. Written to look great on any screen! Check it out on your phone, change your screen orientation, or resize your window to see. Apart from responsiveness, I tried to focus on creating a clean, simple UI. I also took an object-oriented approach to the design of the javascript part of the game. I used the Skeleton CSS framework for this project.
